      <h1>Hello, suspicious person!</h1>
      <p>
        If you're reading this, you most likely encountered an email address of
        the form <strong>some.service@zcot.net</strong> and wondered if the
        website exists and if such an address could be legitimate. I assure you,
        the address you were given is indeed correct, legitimate, and all
        messages sent to it will be delivered to the intended person.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>What is zcot?</h2>
        <p>
          zcot is an email forwarder owned by me, a single individual. It
          accepts messages for virtually any value in the local-part of an
          email address (the text to the left of the <code>@</code>-sign) and
          each received message is forwarded to my real, unshared address.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why was zcot created?</h2>
        <p>
          There are quite a few reasons for this, but most of them boil down to
          a combination of bad experiences with service providers and my own
          dumb intransigence. Some more specific reasons are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Just as there is benefit in never reusing a password across more
            than one service, there is also benefit in never reusing a user
            name&mdash;which in many cases is an email address&mdash;across more
            than one service as well. A zcot address for one service is globally
            unique and not reused on any other service or site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Phishing messages become more obvious, as there is a high likelihood
            that the fake message would not have been sent to the correct zcot
            address for the service that purportedly sent it.
          </li>
          <li>
            When receiving unsolicited and unexpected messages, the presence of
            a zcot address can help determine if the sender is likely to have
            the business relationship they say they do. As a more concrete
            example: an unanticipated message claiming that I am entitled to
            payment in a class action settlement becomes less suspicious if it
            is sent to a zcot address I used during a prior interaction with the
            named defendant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Should a zcot address ever show up in a data breach, it will be
            obvious which service was the source of the data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Should my real address start receiving spam or unwanted marketing
            materials, the zcot address that forwarded the message will reveal
            which service sent the material (or which service shared the address
            with a third party).
          </li>
          <li>
            Using unique and rather meaningless zcot addresses on services
            thwarts unwanted "find me by email" functionality. It also helps
            prevent construction of a social graph from other users who may
            share their contacts list&mdash;in almost all cases the shared
            contacts would not contain any zcot addresses the service has on
            file for me.
          </li>
          <li>
            As companies merge and acquire one another, often user accounts are
            unexpectedly linked in ways that are not predictable, reversible, or
            agreeable. With different zcot addresses at each service, the merged
            entity cannot reliably link the accounts or correlate my identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes it's desirable to create more than one account on a
            service that requires unique email addresses across all
            registrations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who is behind zcot?</h2>
        <p>
          Do you think the person who refused to give you their real email
          address in the first place would volunteer such information so easily?
        </p>
        <p>
          All I'll say is, it ain't exactly a secret. If you take a minute or
          two to do the research, you'll figure it out.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Can't the same thing be accomplished with <code>+</code>?</h2>
        <p>
          Sure it can. But having tried that approach for several years, I found
          it insufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the unaware, many email providers (notably Gmail) allow their
          users to insert a single plus sign (<code>+</code>) in their
          local-part and anything after it will be ignored when delivering the
          messages. So <code>joe+something@example.com</code>,
          <code>joe+anything@example.com</code>, and
          <code>joe+writhing@example.com</code> are three seemingly different
          addresses, but mail sent to each of them will all ultimately go to the
          same mailbox: <code>joe@example.com</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In theory, this should work great for my use case. In practice, it's
          disheartening to discover how many services have boneheaded email
          validation routines that don't consider the plus sign to be a legal
          character. Without exaggeration, I would say one in five services have
          some kind of limitation pertaining to the scheme, in some cases
          resulting in being unable to even log in without contacting customer
          service to restore access. (Have you ever tried talking a CS
          representative through the fact that your email address contains a
          plus sign?) This sort of thing happens with <em>infuriating</em>
          frequency.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the standpoint of creating a bulletproof mechanism for ensuring
          email uniqueness and traceability, the plus sign scheme isn't
          perfect either. The trick is known well enough among developers and
          product designers that the plus-sign portion is often stripped off,
          leaving only the underlying email address. The anonymity, uniqueness,
          and traceability aspects are all lost when this happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a developer, or a person with influence over the design and
          logic rules of a web application, please listen to me:
          <strong>in an email address, every non-empty string is legal to the
          left-hand side of the <code>@</code>-sign.</strong> I don't care what
          regular expression you found on a message board post, or what rules
          are imposed by other competitors' websites, or what your gut thinks is
          correct. Every value&mdash;very short values, very long values,
          quoted spaces, accented characters, &#9748;, complicated sequences of
          combining characters&mdash;every value is legal on the left-hand side
          of the <code>@</code>-sign. The world is a big place, with lots of
          different writing systems and mail server software. To think that your
          service is the end-all arbiter of what is legal and illegal in such a
          vast and complicated world is naive and obstinate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't get me started on your atrocious password restrictions.

        <p>
          Who cares. For what it's worth, I say ZEE-cot.
