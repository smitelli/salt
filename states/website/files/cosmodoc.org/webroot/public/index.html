<pre>You're computer appears to be an 8088/8086 XT system.

Cosmo REQUIRES an AT class (80286) or better to run due to
it's high-speed animated graphics.

Note:  This game will crash on XT systems.
Do you wish to continue if you really have an AT system or better (Y/N)?<span class="blink">&nbsp;</span></pre>
